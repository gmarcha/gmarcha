Hi! I'm a French native interested in distributed/edge computing, zero-trust network and general automation.

I'm working on system and software design, infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, cloud and database migrations, GraphQL ecosystem, Kubernetes environment... I'm coding with Go and Typescript. I put my best efforts to ensure automation and reduce toil at each system level to provide flawless, maintainable and cost-efficient solutions.

## Experiences

During last years, I highly focused on Google Cloud provisioning, K3s deployments and GitOps practices through [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/) and [Argo](https://argoproj.github.io/) with the aim to provide reliable, scalable and secure systems. That leads me to investigate in multi-cloud and hybrid scenarios for deploying Kubernetes. [K3s](https://k3s.io/) and [Rancher](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/getting-started/overview) offers the ability to embrace this kind of scenarios, allowing to deploy control-plane clusters, regional clusters and edge clusters in any desired configuration. I gained good knowledge about network and load balancing issues in distributed systems, from a cloud-hosted or on-premise perspectives. [K0s](https://k0sproject.io/) from Google teams is a good alternative for ready-to-use clusters. For managing multi-cluster infrastructure, there are basically three ecosystems with different level of integration and flexibility: entreprise-grade [OpenShift Container Platform](https://docs.okd.io/latest/installing/index.html) (and OpenShift Platform Plus for multi-cluster control plane) which provides user-provisioned or installer-provisioned installation, open-source [Kubesphere Platform](https://www.kubesphere.io/projects/) based on a full open source stack from observability to continuous integration, the Rancher suite for hybrid-orchestration and flexible scenarios (helped by [Karmada](https://karmada.io/docs/tutorials/autoscaling-with-federatedhpa) cluster federation capabilities, Harvester integration for legacy virtual machine workloads or other external control plane tools). [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) is an alternative and interesting approach for entreprise-grade hybrid-orchestration.

I also investigated authn/authz solutions and became an [Ory.sh](https://www.ory.sh/) user. Compared to keycloak monolithic approach and SSO based on OIDC, Ory is an open source cloud-hosted and headless solution based on a micro-service architecture, each service implementing a precise requirement in a lightweight manner. It is possible to deploy each service (Kratos, Hydra, Oathkeeper, Keto) independently and in a self-hosted fashion. Ory Kratos is an IAM server which integrates with external OIDC providers while Ory Hydra is an OAuth2 server which allows to become an OIDC provider. This micro-service architecture grants so much flexibility to implement multi-tenancy requirements (single server with single database, multiple servers with single database, multiple servers with multiple databases) and to leverage a DevOps approach even for critical operations as authentication and authorization. I would really enjoy to collaborate on an open source RBAC implementation for Ory Keto, using operator pattern for example (see [example](https://docs.mojaloop.io/business-operations-framework-docs/guide/SecurityBC.html)).

I did a lot in CRUD generation from database schemas in OpenAPI ecosystem and then in GraphQL ecosystem, extensively using tools such as [Hasura](https://hasura.io/) or [Graphql-mesh](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/mesh). Thus I'm mostly using Postgres because of its rich ecosystem, its fined grained authorization system with RLS feature and its "easy" migration usage for legacy SQL databases.

Finally I like to design and create user interfaces or 3D experiences to drive my ideas forward, using edge technology to build intuitive and captivating applications.

## Other projects

- [Webserv](https://github.com/c3b5aw/webserv), a HTTP/1.1 C++ server implementation made in pair working with awesome [@c3b5aw](https://github.com/c3b5aw). Support for basic nginx configuration files, event-driven I/O handling, and multiple data response formats (urlencoded, multipart and transfer-encoding chunk mode).
- [PipexMedic](https://github.com/gmarcha/pipexMedic), a C functional tester for a unix system programming project, Pipex. Intensive process creation, low-level inter-process communication, I/O redirection, signal handling. 
- [SoLong](https://github.com/gmarcha/so-long), a 2D game written in C with a X11 library. Implementing an application loop, event handling, frame building and rendering.
